## Helo , my name's Jason

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in the process of setting up a cople of physical models and modded hardware pieces.
- ðŸŒ± As of right now I'm only a beginner at C++, Java, and semi-decent at html, great at working with cisco hardware, and a newbie at Juniper( I blame my roommate she also works IT)
- ðŸ’¬ If you want to experience me rambling for hours ask me about my dogs and the multitude of people I adore.
- ðŸ“« I can be reached via Discord @geniusreaps, reddit via u/TheC0rinthi9n
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him, They/Them
- âš¡ Fun fact: Im a massive fan of the Sandman chronicles written by Neil Gaiman, that's actually where I get my username from he's one of my favorite comic book villians.
- I am currently in the process of getting moved so some of the projects I am working are put on the backburner currently namely the physical ones but feel free to reach out about my programs.
